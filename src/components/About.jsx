          Hi, I'm Khushi Gupta, a frontend web developer driven by creativity,
          problem-solving, and a passion for building clean, responsive, and
          user-friendly websites. I enjoy the process of transforming ideas into
          interactive digital experiences that are both visually appealing and
          highly functional. For me, frontend development is the perfect balance
          of design and technologyâ€”it allows me to bring concepts to life while
          ensuring they deliver real value to users.
        </p>
        
        <p className=" mt-3 text-gray-300 text-xl">
          My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind
          CSS, along with experience in responsive design and modern development
          practices. I focus on writing efficient, maintainable code while
          paying close attention to the finer details that enhance usability,
          such as accessibility, smooth navigation, and performance
          optimization.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mt-3 text-gray-300 text-xl">
          I'm a continuous learner who loves exploring new tools, frameworks,
          and trends in web development. With every project, I aim to grow as a
          developer and create meaningful solutions that not only meet client or
          user needs but also leave a positive, lasting impression.
